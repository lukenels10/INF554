        <div>
            <b>Cons:</b>
            <p>1. This infographic is really original and humorous. Comparing sea level with height of child can help people remember the image and get the point of the infographic.
                <br>2. The infographic is figurative. Blue wave is similar to sea level and when you see it, you can relate them together. Using ice, child, adult images are also figurative.
                <br>3. Fonts is elegant and color palettes are carefully crafted. And I think it does not interfere with the information he wants to present.
                <br>4. This infographic has little redundancy. It shows sea levels' change in different places, the cause of sea rise and the trend of sea levels in the future. 
            </p>
            <b>Pons:</b>
            <p>This infographic focuses more on style rather than content. Multidimensionality is not enough.</p>
            <b>Suggestion:</b>
            <p>1. Offer a summary of the data. 
                <br>2. Seek depth and add differnt dimensions to analyze data. For example, display other reasons and their proportions why sea level rise.

            <a href="https://globalwarmingisreal.com/sea-level-rise-infographic/">Second Infographic:</a>
        </h2>
        <div id="pic2">
            <img src="./img2.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">
        </div>
        <div id="wheel2">
            <img src="./wheel2.png" width="50%" height="50%">
        </div>

        <div>
            <b>Cons:</b>
            <p>1. This infographic is multidimensionality, which analyze why temperature influences sea level, comparation with carbon emisions, temperature as well as polar ice caps, sea levels vary across cities, trends of sea levels along time and the results of sea level rise.
                <br>2. The animal images are figurative and can attract people's attention.
                <br>3. The first half part of infographic is concise and easy understand.
                <br>4. This infographic has little redundant information.
            </p>
            <b>Pons:</b>
            <p>The second half part of this infographic contains too much descriptions and the structure is mess, which can make readers bored.</p>
            <b>Suggestion:</b>
            <p>1. Offer a summary of the data. 
                <br>2. Find the right balance between density and lightness. For example, use more graphs to display second half part information and simplify the descriptions.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Comparison:</h2>
        <p>
            The first infographic is more lightness and with more decoration and it shows less dimensions compared to second infographic. Because second infographic uses much descriptions, it's density is higher. 
            The first infographic is more creative, because it associates sea level with height of child.
            I think both infographics are figurative bacause of using blue waves, which is similar to blue levels. Also, first infographic uses child and people image and second infographic uses animal image, which are also figurative.
            And none of them have much redundancy.
