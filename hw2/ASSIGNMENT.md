# INF 554 Assignment 2

## Description

Use UN Data for the same 10 countries of Assignment 1 to create a bubble cloud with [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org). Add the SVG created with Inkscape in `index.html`. In the same page, recreate the bubble cloud with SVG elements and using javascript to dynamically generate the SVG. Use browsersync to develop. Describe your data and charts as needed in the page. Document your set-up in `README.md`.

Specifically, you will create three bubble charts in one HTML document:

* **SVG Prototype** created with [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org) and added using the `<img>` in `index.html`.
* **SVG Code**: recreated with SVG elements in `index.html` Do not paste the SVG generated by Inkscape, instead look at the SVG by Inkscape to see what attributes and values you need to position and style and write your own code). Use a `style.css` file as appropriate.
* **Dynamic SVG**: recreate using JavaScript, i.e., to dynamically generate the SVG. Put your javascript code in `chart.js`.

## Rubric

| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Sophisticated | Demonstrated use of node.js and sound Web development techniques, well documented, shows proficiency in using git (4-5 pts)| Prototype is well thought out showing both relations and quantities (4-5 pts)| Code cleanly written and debugged (4-5 pts)| Code cleanly written and debugged (4-5 pts)|
| Competent     | Not using or not demonstrated use of node.js and Web development techniques, some documentation, shows some proficiency in using git (2-3 pts) | Prototype shows some thoughts and/or showing some relations and quantities (2-3 pts)| Code cleanly written with minor problems (2-3 pts)| Code cleanly written with minor problems (2-3 pts)|
| Needs work    | Not using node.js and Web editor, poorly or not documented, not using git appropriately (0-1 pts)| Prototype is not well thought out and/or not showing relations and quantities (0-1 pts)| Code not well written and/or not debugged (0-1 pts)| Code not well written and/or not debugged (0-1 pts)|
