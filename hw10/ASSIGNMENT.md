# INF 554 Assignment 10

## Description

Use a subset of your project data to demonstrate basic statistical plots using ggplot2, ggmap, and plotly in RStudio. Publish your plots to RPubs.

## Rubric

### Development and published notebook (5 pts)

Demonstrate good development practices:

- Provide a link to published RPubs notebook in [README.md](README.md)
- Create an R *project* and a notebook that will contain your plots
- Create a data folder to hold your data
- Use incremental commits that are meaningful e.g. each commit adds one feature/component
- Test that your code works before you commit

| Quality       | Points | Description |
| ------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Sophisticated | 4-5    | Use of RStudio is demonstrated. Set-up is proper for project, notebook, and data. Deployment is documented. |
| Competent     | 2-3    | Use of RStudio is not well demonstrated. Set-up for project, notebook, and data is not well done. Deployment is not well documented. |
| Needs work    | 0-1    | Use of RStudio is not demonstrated. Set-up is for project, notebook, and data is not done. Deployment is not documented. |

### Notebook and plots (5 pts)

Refer to *ggplot2-notebook.Rmd* from the lectures for the types of plots to include, i.e., basic statistical plots, faceting, a map with ggmap showing data, and an interactive chart with plotly.

| Quality       | Points | Description |
| ------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Sophisticated | 4-5    | All plots requested are included. Notebook is properly formatted with R Markdown. RPubs export is working well. |
| Competent     | 2-3    | Not all plots requested are included. Notebook is not properly formatted with R Markdown. RPubs export is not working well. |
| Needs work    | 0-1    | No plots requested are included. Notebook is not formatted with R Markdown. RPubs export is not working. |

## Homework Guidelines

- Homework repository must be updated before the start of next class
- Commits after the submission deadline will not be considered unless requested
- Late policy: 10% of total available points per each 24-hour late; duration less than 24 hours counts as one whole 24-hour

## Important Note from Graders

Homework will sometimes be assessed on Linux systems which use case-sensitive filesystems. Ensure that you use the same case when referring to files. For example, if your code refers to `myFile.csv`, but the actual filename is `myfile.csv`, the code will fail on said systems. We will deduct points if this happens. Double-check filenames to avoid this problem.
