## index.html description

-  **Picture 1** : Describe total fertility rate trend within 65 years for 10 countries. Data stored on google sheet and is displayed as column chart. The picture is saved on github and cannot be interactive.
-  **Picture 2** : Meaning and customation is same as Picture 1. It is a Google Sheet chart and embedded in iframe tag. This chart is interactive. When you hover it, it displays the fertility rate.
-  **Picture 3** : Describe total fertility rate trend within 65 years for 10 countries. This is a line chart built using Google Charts. It is also interactive.


I think column chart can be better because data is grouped by each country and it is more cognitive.
